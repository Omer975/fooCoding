                <hr>
                <p>Positive, social and analytic, self-going yet a teamwork at the same time. A person that doesn’t look
                    at problems as a problem but thinks solutions. I'm passionate for new technologies that involves IT
                    Infrastructure and Security. Working with governments, banks, universities and hospitals has taught
                    me to combine IT skills with professionalism always helping the clients finding the best solution.

                    Being self driven, loyal and devoted to my tasks, product and company has always inspired me to be
                    and offer the best services and product.

                    A good working environment is healthy so I add togetherness, laughter and humbleness to the team. I
                    would describe my self as responsible, polite, respectful and fun person with a good humor that
                    adapts very well.</p>
